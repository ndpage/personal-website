                    Hello!

                <p>
                    My name is Nathan and I am an engineer in Greenville, South Carolina with nearly three years of experience in  
                    control systems and software development.
                    <br> My background is primarily in control systems and embedded software in C,
                    but I have been exploring other types of systems and software development such as web develpement. 
                    I am current learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
                    I am also diving into Artificial Intelligence by learning how to use Python for machine learning.

                            I am currently using NI LabVIEW and NI CompacRIO hardware to develop a new control and data acquisition system. 
                            You can see more information about the project on my LinkedIn page.

                            During my last year in university, I worked as an engineering intern at GE Aviation in Asheville, North Carolina.
                            My primary goals were to increase the effeciency of a manufacturing process using Lean techniques. 
                            A colleague and I performed time studies to determine the slowest operation in the manufacturing process. 
                            We were able to improve the cycle time and increase efficiency by modifying the process steps.

                            During the summer of 2017 I was an engineering intern at GE Power in Greenville, South Carolina.  My primary responsibilites 
                                were to develop applications using GE Cimplicity to monitor plant power and process gas usage, and find ways to save energy and money.
